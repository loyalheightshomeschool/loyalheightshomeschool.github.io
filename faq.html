    <div class="question">How do I register for classes?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Registration typically starts 4 to 6 weeks before the start of the upcoming quarter. Classes can fill quickly, so it is best to register early. In cases of low enrollment, classes may be cancelled up to two weeks before the session begins. For the sake of the teachers and other students, please try and register early!</p>
      <p>There are three ways to register for classes:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Online:</strong> Visit the <a href="https://anc.apm.activecommunities.com/seattle/activity/search?activity_select_param=2&amp;activity_keyword=homeschool&amp;viewMode=list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seattle Parks and Recreation website</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>By phone:</strong> Call the Loyal Heights Community Center at (206) 684-4052.</li>
        <li><strong>In person:</strong> Go to any Seattle Community Center and register in person at the front desk.</li>
      </ol>

    <div class="question">Are there scholarships?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Seattle Parks and Recreation offers scholarships for qualifying families. Applications are available starting in the summer for the following school year. You can apply at any time and your scholarship will apply to all classes for the rest of the school year.</p>
      <p>If you wish to use funds to register for classes, you must be approved PRIOR to registering. Approval can take up to several weeks. Applying early helps ensure you will get the funds, if you are eligible. Sometimes, they do not have enough funds to meet the demand and in those instances, scholarships are granted on a first come, first served basis.</p>
      <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/scholarships-and-financial-aid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seattle Parks and Recreation website</a> for eligibility guidelines, application form, and other information.</p>

  <li class="qa">
    <div class="question">What ages does this program serve?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Classes are offered for students ages 3 to 18. Younger siblings are welcome to come and play in the common area or outside on the playground. There is a toddler-aged play area in the common area of the community center.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="qa">
    <div class="question">Is this a drop off program? Or do I need to stay on site with my child/children?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A child must be at least 11 years old to be dropped off without parental supervision, if there is a break between classes. For children under 11, a designated adult must remain on site, though it does not have to be the child’s parent.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="qa">
    <div class="question">Can I stay with my child in the classroom?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>This decision is up to each individual teacher. If you are unsure if your child is ready to be dropped off without you in the classroom, you can reach out to the teacher to ask if staying in the classroom is okay with them. Contact a committee member if you need help connecting with a specific teacher.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="qa">
    <div class="question">Can my child register for class if s/he is outside the stated age range?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Students outside the age range for a class need teacher approval. Teachers make the age variance policy for their classes. If approved, the teacher lets the front desk know the full name of the student and the parent will need to register the student in person or by calling the Loyal Heights Community Center at (206) 684-4052. Online registration will not allow age variances.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="qa">
    <div class="question">Are there waitlists for classes that are full?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>If a class is full, a waitlist will be started. If space becomes available, you will be notified and can register at that time by phone or in person. In some cases, class limits may be expanded, and withdrawals do occasionally occur.</p>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li class="qa">
    <div class="question">I changed my mind and want to withdraw from a class I’ve signed up for. Can I get a refund?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>A refund is available if a student drops the class before the second class. You will receive a prorated refund, minus service charge. See the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/reserve/refunds-reductions-and-waivers" target="_blank">Seattle Parks and Recreation Refund Policy</a> for more details.</p>

    <div class="question">Can I come to hang out with LHH without signing up for classes?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Yes! Homeschooling families are welcome to spend time with us at the Loyal Heights Community Center on Wednesdays, primarily between 10:00 and 3:00 pm. The community center is an inviting space with a play area for babies and toddlers, and a sitting area where parents like to sit and hang out while they sip coffee or tea from our parent-donated coffee/tea station. Outside, there is a large grassy area, playground, a small basketball court, and a large turf field. If you plan to come for the first time, we encourage you to let us know ahead of time, so that we can greet you and show you around. Email us at <a href="mailto:loyalheightshomeschool@gmail.com">loyalheightshomeschool@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <div class="question">How does the community connect outside of classes?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>Social events and workshops are scheduled between quarters and during the summer, and individuals sometimes organize field trips other days during the year. Past events have included such activities as roller skating at Lynnwood Bowl &amp; Skate, tabletop gaming at Café Mox, beach day at Golden Gardens, cheap summer movies, and more.</p>

    <div class="question">How can I get involved?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The LHH community is always in need of volunteers to keep our program running. Everything from teaching a class, to helping setup and clean up for teachers, to serving on the committee. If you have questions about what our current needs are, please contact us at <a href="mailto:loyalheightshomeschool@gmail.com">loyalheightshomeschool@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <div class="question">What is the LHH Committee?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The LHH Committee is a group of parent volunteers who plan and run the LHH Program. In addition to putting together the schedule of classes for each quarter, the committee manages all our communications (<a href="https://loyalheightshomeschool.org/">website</a>,  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://groups.google.com/g/loyalheightshomeschool" target="_blank">Google Email Group</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/687483054658790" target="_blank">Facebook Group</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/loyalheightshomeschool" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>), and plans community events throughout the year. You can reach us in person on Wednesdays, or via email at <a href="mailto:loyalheightshomeschool@gmail.com">loyalheightshomeschool@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <li class="qa">
    <div class="question">What is your Health and Safety Policy?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>At LHH, we use a combination of approaches to help keep our program safe and accessible to all our families.</p>
      <p><strong>Air flow and filtration:</strong> The community center has HEPA filters in two classrooms, and we will leave the windows open in the 3rd classroom and lobby. Please plan to layer in case of cooler weather.</p>
      <p><strong>Stay home when sick:</strong> As much as we love to be together, we ask that people stay home when symptomatic with a viral infection. For guidance, see this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://doh.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/420456-COVID19DecisionTrees.pdf">Symptom and Exposure Flowchart</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Masks are optional:</strong> While masks are not required at the community center, please respect those who choose to wear one. If you see someone wearing a mask, consider they may: have unvaccinated family members, feel ill and not want to get you sick, be immuno-compromised, have high-risk loved ones, or prefer to wear a mask. Please be kind and respect everyone’s choice. The community center has a supply of adult size masks available for use.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> We would like our program to be accessible to as much of the community as possible, but LHH families should know that the community center is a mask-optional facility that is open to the public daily. Other activities, such as preschools, weight room, and after school programs take place within the building at the same time as our program. Some members feel more comfortable hanging out outdoors at the playground, grass, or playfields. We hope you will feel welcome either indoors or out.</p>
