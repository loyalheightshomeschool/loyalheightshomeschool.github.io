title: Welcome!

Loyal Heights Homeschool Program (LHH) is a community of homeschooling families who gather each Wednesday at the Loyal Heights Community Center in Seattle to learn and play. We meet from September to May and offer a chance for families to play and connect with other homeschoolers. Please join us; we look forward to meeting you!

LHH is led by a committee of parent volunteers who develop the class schedule and organize events for the families of the LHH community. We partner with the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department who helps administer our program by hosting the registration system and providing the location for our classes. Classes run on a quarterly schedule in the fall, winter and spring. Each quarter is approximately 9 weeks long.

The LHH program provides a sense of community among homeschooling families as we gather each week to attend classes, play, and enjoy each otherâ€™s company. However, you do not need to be registered for classes to join us. You are welcome to come any Wednesday we are in session to meet and play with other homeschool families. Please let us know you are coming so that we can meet you and show you around.

### Newcomers

If you are a newcomer interested in our program and would like to learn more, we encourage you to come in person to check it out. The majority of families are typically at the Loyal Heights Community Center from around 10:00 am to 3:00 pm on Wednesdays when classes are being held. If you would like someone to greet you when you arrive, please email loyalheightshomeschool@gmail.com in advance of the day you plan to come. We will make sure one of our parent volunteers is available to give you a tour, answer questions, and introduce you to other families.
