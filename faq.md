**How do I register for classes?**

Registration typically starts 4 to 6 weeks before the start of the upcoming quarter. The LHH Committee will send reminders through our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/loyalheightshomeschool" target="_blank">Facebook Page</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/687483054658790" target="_blank">Facebook Group</a>, and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/loyalheightshomeschool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Email Group</a> to spread the word about registering. Classes can fill quickly, so it is best to register early. In cases of low enrollment, classes may be cancelled up to two weeks before the session begins. For the sake of the teachers and other students, please try and register early!

There are three ways to register for classes:

1. Online: Visit the <a href="https://anc.apm.activecommunities.com/seattle/activity/search?activity_select_param=2&amp;activity_keyword=homeschool&amp;viewMode=list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seattle Parks and Recreation website</a>.
2. By phone: Call the Loyal Heights Community Center at (206) 684-4052.
3. In person: Go to any Seattle Community Center and register in person at the front desk.

**Are there scholarships?**

Seattle Parks and Recreation offers scholarships for qualifying families. Applications are available starting in the summer for the following school year. You can apply at any time and your scholarship will apply to all classes for the rest of the school year.

The primary income-earner in your household is the person who should fill out the application. Although their website states that you can apply at any community center or pool, past experience by LHH families has shown that the fastest way to get approved is in person at the Loyal Heights Community Center. Make sure you have all the necessary documents with you. The primary applicant should bring their completed application, photo ID and all required income and dependency documentation. It is beneficial to list all dependents, including babies, even if you are not planning on enrolling them in classes.

If you wish to use funds to register for classes, you must be approved PRIOR to registering. Approval can take up to several weeks. Applying early helps ensure you will get the funds, if you are eligible. Sometimes, they do not have enough funds to meet the demand and in those instances, scholarships are granted on a first come, first served basis.

Visit the <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/scholarships-and-financial-aid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seattle Parks and Recreation website</a> for eligibility guidelines, application form, and other information.

**What ages does this program serve?**

Classes are offered for students ages 3 to 18. Younger siblings are welcome to come and play in the common area or outside on the playground. There is a toddler-aged play area in the common area of the community center.

**Is this a drop off program? Or do I need to stay on site with my child/children?**

A child must be at least 11 years old to be dropped off without parental supervision, if there is a break between classes. For children under 11, a designated adult must remain on site, though it does not have to be the child’s parent.

**Can I stay with my child in the classroom?**

This decision is up to each individual teacher. If you are unsure if your child is ready to be dropped off without you in the classroom, you can reach out to the teacher to ask if staying in the classroom is okay with them. Contact a committee member if you need help connecting with a specific teacher.

**Can my child register for class if s/he is outside the stated age range?**

Students outside the age range for a class need teacher approval. Teachers make the age variance policy for their classes. If approved, the teacher lets the front desk know the full name of the student and the parent will need to register the student in person or by calling the Loyal Heights Community Center at (206) 684-4052. Online registration will not allow age variances.

**Are there waitlists for classes that are full?**

If a class is full, a waitlist will be started. If space becomes available, you will be notified and can register at that time by phone or in person. In some cases, class limits may be expanded, and withdrawals do occasionally occur.

**I changed my mind and want to withdraw from a class I’ve signed up for. Can I get a refund?**

A refund is available if a student drops the class before the second class. You will receive a prorated refund, minus service charge. See the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.seattle.gov/parks/reserve/refunds-reductions-and-waivers" target="_blank">Seattle Parks and Recreation Refund Policy</a> for more details.

**Can I come to hang out with LHH without signing up for classes?**

Yes! Homeschooling families are welcome to spend time with us at the Loyal Heights Community Center on Wednesdays, primarily between 10:00 and 3:00 pm. The community center is an inviting space with a play area for babies and toddlers, and a sitting area where parents like to sit and hang out while they sip coffee or tea from our parent-donated coffee/tea station. Outside, there is a large grassy area, playground, a small basketball court, and a large turf field. If you plan to come for the first time, we encourage you to let us know ahead of time, so that we can greet you and show you around. Email us at <a href="mailto:loyalheightshomeschool@gmail.com">loyalheightshomeschool@gmail.com</a>.

**How do I find out about what’s going on at LHH?**

**How does the community connect outside of classes?**

Social events and workshops are scheduled between quarters and during the summer, and individuals sometimes organize field trips other days during the year.

**How can I get involved?**

The LHH community is always in need of volunteers to keep our program running. Everything from teaching a class, to helping setup and clean up for teachers, to serving on the committee.
