A collective environment which allows children to build community through shared experiences and deepen connection with earth and each other. We begin each day with an acknowledgement of gratitude for the natural world around us and everything that it provides. Children learn quickly and authentically to identify all of the things around them in which they are grateful for. This is a precious and important practice and a theme that is held throughout the day. Students are taught how to safely use knives as tools for skills such as fire building, carving and crafting. There is a strong focus on community building through working together on shelter creating, fire building, cooperative nature games and conflict resolution.
